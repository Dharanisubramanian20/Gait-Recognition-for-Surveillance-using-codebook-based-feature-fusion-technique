# Gait-Recognition-for-Surveillance-using-codebook-based-feature-fusion-technique
Gait analysis is an assessment of the way the body moves, usually by walking or running, from one place to another. The purpose of gait analysis is to detect any abnormalities in the locomotion of an individual. The main purpose of gait analysis is to recognize the identity of an individual without making any physical interaction of the user with the system. The gait sequences can be recorded using simple devices. Since the gait-based person identification is less susceptible to noise as compared to other biometrics, it can perform equally well even in low-resolution videos. Gait can be used for visual surveillance applications. Gait analysis can also be used in the medical domain for diagnosis and in the sports domain for improving the performance of athletes. In this project, a codebook-based feature encoding technique has been proposed for action recognition, and image and video classification. Our goal is to use machine learning techniques to unravel the best practices to build an efficient gait recognition system.
